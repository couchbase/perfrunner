Measurement-calibrated Graph Modeling for OSN Analysis v1.2b (11/17/11)
-----------------------------------------------------------
For questions, please contact adelbert_chang@cs.ucsb.edu

This package is a tool to be used for synthetic graph generation
targeted at original input graphs, using various graph modeling
procedures. Fitting code is included to help determine which
generated synthetic graph is closest to the original input graph.

For more information, please refer to our lab website, the project
website, and our published paper (which can be found on the project
website).

Files
-----------------------------------------------------------
*Make sure Python 2.7+, NetworkX, and Orbis have been
installed. They can be found at http://python.org,
http://networkx.lanl.gov, and
http://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/~pmahadevan/topo_research/topo.html
respectively.

demo.py
Run via 'python demo.py' to get a walkthrough on how to use
our code. We suggest you run this on a GNU Screen, as the demo
may take a while when running the script, depending on the
machine it is run on.

fitModel.py
Code for fitting the graph models discussed in [1] to an input
graph. The script generated several synthetic graphs by varying
the parameters of the graph model selected. A file is outputted as well
that describes how close/far the synthetic graphs are to the input.

    Parameters are varied as such:
    -Barabasi-Albert has only static parameters, hence no fitting code.
     n = # of nodes, m = |E| / n of input graph

    -Modified Forest Fire has one variable 'p', which is fine-grained
     sampled from 0.01 to 0.99 in increments of 0.01.

    -Modified Random Walk has two variables, 'qe' and 'qv.' For coarse
     sampling, each is varied between 0 and 1 in increments of 0.1.
     For fine sampling, qe is fixed and qv is varied across the intervals in
     increments of 0.01.

    -Modified Nearest Neighbor has two variables, 'u' and 'k'. 'u'
     is varied between 0 and 1 in increments of 0.05 and 'k' is varied
     from 1 to 10 in increments of 1. For fine sampling, k is fixed
     and u is varied across intervals in increments of 0.01.


fitModel_noPickling.py
Same as fitModel.py, but each synthetic graph is not put into
a Python .pickle format, saving on computation time.

socialModels.py
Graph generation code based on our modified Forest Fire, modified
Random Walk, and modified Nearest-Neighbor models. For more information,
please refer to [1].

twoKDistance.py
Helper module for the fitModel(_noPickling).py script, calculates
the dK-2 distance between the synthetic graphs and the input graph.
A small dK-2 distance indicates a close match.


Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------
Make sure Python 2.7+, NetworkX, and Orbis are installed. 
Once that is done, the script can be run.


Licensing
-----------------------------------------------------------
Refer to the LICENSE file.


Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------
fitModel[_noPickling].py

    $ python fitModel.py -ff/-rw/-nn <graph name> <pickle path> 
    <path of dKDist code> <path of output folder>[parameter(s) 
    if using modified Random walk model]

The additional parameters for fitting our modified Random Walk
model are '-coarse/-fine'. If '-fine' is selected, 3 additional
parameters must be added that indicate the qe_start, qe_end , 
qv_start, and qv_end intervals. THESE INTERVALS ARE CLOSED. That
is, the final values of qv will hit and finish qv_end
sampling before terminating, not before.
*Coarse sampling should be run first. Then using the *_dkDistances.txt
file, identify intervals for which the dK-2 distance is smallest.
Then run fine sampling on those intervals.

After the fitting script is done running, check the corresponding
*_dkDistances.txt file. Look for the parameters with the smallest
dK-2 distance, which indicates the closest synthetic graph.

Example usage (to excluding the pickling process, simple replace
the occurences of 'fitModel.py' with 'fitModel_noPicking.py'):
-----------------------------------------------------------
To run coarse fitting for the Nearest Neighbor model..

    $ python fitModel.py -nn mySocialGraph pickles/myOSN.pickle
      ~/code/Orbis_Source/dkDist results/coarseNN/ -coarse

To run fine fitting for the Nearest Neighbor model..

    $ python fitModel.py -nn mySocialGraph pickles/myOSN.pickle
      ~/code/Orbis_Source/dkDist results/fineNN/ -fine 0.1 0.3 0.4

To run coarse fitting for modified Random Walk...

    $ python fitModel.py -rw mySocialGraph pickles/myOSN.pickle
      ~/code/Orbis_Source/dkDist results/coarseRW/ -coarse

To run fine fitting for modified Random Walk...

    $ python fitModel.py -rw mySocial Graph pickles/myOSN.pickle
      ~/code/Orbis_Source/dkDist results/fineRW/ -fine 0.2 0.3 0.1 0.2



*socialModels.py is a module containing code for our modified Forest Fire,
modified Random Walk, and modified Nearest Neighbor models. Using it
is as simple as doing something like:

    >>> import networkx as nx
    >>> import socialModels as sm
    >>> G = sm.nearestNeighbor_mod(239694, 0.9, 3)

The Barabasi-Albert model has already been implemented in NetworkX under
networkx.generators.random_graphs.barabasi_albert_graph. 

Orbis/dK-2 code in C++ can be found at 
http://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/~pmahadevan/topo_research/topo.html

The Kronecker Model (+ fitting code) can be found in the C++ SNAP library at 
http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/download.html
